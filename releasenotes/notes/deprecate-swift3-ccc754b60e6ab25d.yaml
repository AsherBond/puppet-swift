upgrade:
  - |
    puppet-swift now fails if swift3 is included in ``swift::proxy::pipeline``,
    because it no longer supports configuration for swift3 middleware. Use
    s3api instead to provide S3-compatible API.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``swift::proxy::swift3`` class has been deprecated because swift3
    middleware is no longer maintained. Use ``swift::proxy::s3api`` instead
    to use built-in s3api middleware in swift.
